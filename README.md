[Will Norris](https://github.com/willnorris)
at Google has done a great job writing a Go client to talk to the
[Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

I have begun to write several examples which outline how to use
this API simply and easily.

Will also has some examples and tests in his repository as well.

But I was experimenting with talking to the Github API through
various clients written in different languages to see how they
perform and scale.

Will's version of talking to the Github API is clearly one of the best.
